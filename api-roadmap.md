## Security & Performance Considerations

### Security Measures
- JWT token authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting (100 requests/minute for authenticated users)
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CORS configuration
- HTTPS enforcement
- File upload security (virus scanning, type validation)

### Performance Optimizations
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Caching strategy (Redis for session data, query results)
- API response compression
- Pagination for large datasets
- Background job processing for heavy operations
- CDN for static file delivery
- Database connection pooling

### Monitoring & Logging
- API request/response logging
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring
- User activity tracking
- System health checks
- Automated backup procedures
